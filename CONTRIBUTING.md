# Contributing

This repository follows a simplified [Forking Workflow][forking_workflow] (an adaptation from the [Gitflow Workflow][gitflow_workflow]) to manage changes and branches. Detailed explanation could be found [here][maintainers_guidelines]. In practice, just follow these steps:

1. create your own fork of the repository
2. branch off from the latest `master` branch
3. finish changes in the feature branch
4. create pull request to the `master` branch and go through the review process

Done!

## Working with a fork

![a typical git fork][fork_repo]

For team-managed projects (like this one), even if you have the access to make changes directly through `git push`, it is still recommended to makes changes through pull requests so that all changes could be reviewed, verified, and clearly recorded as commits. To do that, follow the forking workflow used in most open-source projects.

### Creating a fork

After creating a fork of a repository, make sure to [configure a remote][git_configure_remote] first so the fork can sync up with the remote repository. For example, when working on a fork from this repository, do this first:

```batch
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ms-iot/vscode-ros
```

*Note: the remote name does not need to be `upstream`, we are just using `upstream` as an example*

### Syncing a fork

Forks do not automatically sync with the original repository, to keep forks up-to-date, here are a few ways to accomplish that:

1. `fetch + merge` as described in GitHub's [syncing a fork guide][git_sync_fork]

    ```batch
    git fetch -p upstream
    git checkout <branch>
    git merge upstream/<branch>
    ```

2. `pull upstream` (`git pull` is a wrapper for `fetch + merge`)

    ```batch
    git checkout <branch>
    git pull upstream <branch>
    ```

It is important to know that the above commands will only update the local git copy, the remote of the fork will not be updated. To keep both the local and the remote repositories up-to-date, make sure to do a `git push` after syncing.

## Build Instructions

Please follow the following instructions to set up a development environment for extension development.

### Dependencies

As a TypeScript project, this extension has dependencies on:

* [`Node.js`][nodejs]
* `npm` ([distributed with `Node.js`][npmjs-get_npm])

After installing `node` (and `npm`), clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ms-iot/vscode-ros
```

### Build

It is recommended to sync with upstream and update dependencies by running [`npm ci`][npmjs-ci] before making changes.

*It is recommended to use `npm ci` instead of [`npm install`][npmjs-install].
This is because `npm ci` consumes `package-lock.json` to ensure the same version is used for all nested dependencies.*

```bash
cd vscode-ros
# sync with upstream

npm ci
code .
```

You can now go to the Debug viewlet (`Ctrl+Shift+D`), select `Extension`, and then hit run (`F5`).

This will open a new VS Code window which will have the title `[Extension Development Host]`.
In this window, open any ROS workspace.

### Debug

In the original VS Code window, you can add breakpoints which will be hit when they are executed.

If you make edits in the extension `.ts` files, just reload/restart (`Ctrl+Shift+F5`) the `[Extension Development Host]` instance of Code to load in the new extension code. Similarly, you could also execute the `Developer: Reload Window` command through command palette in the `[Extension Development Host]` instance.

The debugging instance will automatically reattach.

### Running the tests

To run the tests locally, open the Debug viewlet (`Ctrl+Shift+D`), select `Tests`, then hit run (`F5`).

### Sideloading the extension

After making changes locally, you might want to test it end to end.
To do this, you can sideload the extension.
This can be done by [packaging the extension][vscode-package_extension] and loading the `.vsix` directly.
In the workspace, follow these steps:

```batch
npm install -g vsce
npm ci
vsce package
```

Then in any VS Code instance, run the command `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`.
Choose the `.vsix` file generated in the previous step
